# Granny Cam Motion Detector

This Python script uses OpenCV to detect motion in a video stream from a camera. When motion is detected, it draws a rectangle around the moving object and plays an alert sound.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- winsound (for playing alert sound)

## Usage
1. Make sure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
2. Run the script `main.py`.
3. The script will open the default camera and start detecting motion.
4. Press 'q' to exit the script.

## File Structure
- `main.py`: Contains the motion detection script.
- `alert.wav`: Alert sound file.

Feel free to customize the script as needed!
